      Category Attributes
      ===================
  
        name:       The name of the cataegory to display to the user in the DMA Wizard. (If only one category is entered
                    it will not be displayed as a sub-category in the wizard. Instead it will just be used when the
                    user selects its associated instance.)
        
        enabled:    [OPTIONAL] "true" or "false". If not provided it defaults to true. If false, 
                    this category and its locations are not included in the DMA Wizard. Note: this value can be set 
                    to an expression referencing parameters by using `=` (e.g. `="Your Expression here"`).
        
        bytes_in_burst: Integer between 1 and 127. The number of bytes that can be sent/recieved in a single burst.
        
        bytes_in_burst_is_strict: "true" or "false". Determines whether the bytes_in_burst is a maximum value (false)
                                  or a specific value that must be used (true).
                            
        spoke_width:        Integer between 1 and 4. The spoke width in bytes. 
        
        inc_addr:           "true" or "false". Specifies whether or not the address is typically incremented.
     
        each_busrt_req_request: "true" or "false". Specifies whether or not a request is required for each burst.
     
      Location Attributes
      ===================
      
        name:      The name of the location to display to the user in the DMA Wizard.
       
        enabled:  [OPTIONAL] "true" or "false". If not provided it defaults to true. If false, this 
                  location is not included in the DMA Wizard. Note: this value can be set to an expression 
                  referencing parameters by using `=Your Expression here`.
       
        direction: "source", "destination", or "both".
